#Cyclist Ride Share Data Analysis
Introduction


Welcome to the Cyclist Ride Share Data Analysis repository! In this project, we dive deep into meticulously cleaned and processed data to extract valuable insights. These insights serve as the foundation for data-driven decisions by Cyclistic's Executive team. Our goal is to craft effective marketing strategies geared towards transforming casual riders into loyal annual members.

Background
In 2016, Cyclistic initiated a groundbreaking bike-share program that has since flourished into a robust network. With 5,824 bicycles strategically placed across 692 stations in Chicago, Cyclistic offers unmatched convenience. Bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other, providing unparalleled flexibility. Previously, Cyclistic's marketing approach focused on widespread awareness and broad consumer appeal. The success of this approach was bolstered by versatile pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and coveted annual memberships. Casual riders opt for single-ride or full-day passes, while Cyclistic members subscribe annually.

Scenario
Imagine yourself as a junior data analyst within Cyclistic's Marketing Analyst team. The director of marketing firmly believes that Cyclistic's future hinges on maximizing annual memberships. Consequently, your team is tasked with unraveling the distinct usage patterns of casual riders and annual members. By understanding these differences, we aim to devise a compelling marketing strategy. This strategy will focus on converting casual riders into loyal annual members. The executive team's approval rests on the strength of our insights and the professionalism of our data visualizations.

Theories/Assumptions
Profitability: Annual members yield significantly higher profits than casual riders.
Conversion Ease: Converting existing casual riders to annual members is more feasible than acquiring entirely new annual members.
